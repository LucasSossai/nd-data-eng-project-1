# Data Engineering Nanodegree Project 1: Data Modeling with Postgres

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. 

Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

This project aims on modeling the data with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using python.

## Getting Started

Pre-requisites:

- Python 3
- PostgreSQL
- virtualenv

First create virtualenv and install requirements

``` sh
virtualenv .venv --python=`which python3`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Datasets
### Song dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/).
```json
{
   "num_songs":1,
   "artist_id":"AR36F9J1187FB406F1",
   "artist_latitude":56.27609,
   "artist_longitude":9.51695,
   "artist_location":"Denmark",
   "artist_name":"Bombay Rockers",
   "song_id":"SOBKWDJ12A8C13B2F3",
   "title":"Wild Rose (Back 2 Basics Mix)",
   "duration":230.71302,
   "year":0
}
```
### Log dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above.

### Log data json example
```json
{
   "artist":"Mr Oizo",
   "auth":"Logged In",
   "firstName":"Kaylee",
   "gender":"F",
   "itemInSession":3,
   "lastName":"Summers",
   "length":144.03873,
   "level":"free",
   "location":"Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, AZ",
   "method":"PUT",
   "page":"NextSong",
   "registration":1540344794796.0,
   "sessionId":139,
   "song":"Flat 55",
   "status":200,
   "ts":1541106352796,
   "userAgent":"\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/35.0.1916.153 Safari\/537.36\"",
   "userId":"8"
}
```

## Usage

First lets activate the virtualenv

``` sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

The script create_tables drops and creates your tables. You run this file to reset your tables before each time you run your ETL scripts.

``` sh
python create_tables.py
```

The etl script reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into your tables.

``` sh
python etl.py
```
